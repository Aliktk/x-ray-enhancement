# X-Ray Images Enhancement

## Abstract
The main objective of this project is to improve the visualization of fractured bones using three image enhancement algorithms: **contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization** (CLAHE), **unsharping mask** (UM) and  **high-frequency emphasis filtering** (HEF) After implementing these algorithms, we will discuss about the results and the difficulties found during the development of the project.

Unprocessed images of x-ray films, like this one of a chest, made by *Nikola Zivaljevic, M.D.* and found at the [National Sciente Foundation Multimedia Gallery](https://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.jsp?med_id=52110), will be used in this project.

## Images Source

Besides the first image (001.tif), found at the [National Sciente Foundation Multimedia Gallery](https://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.jsp?med_id=52110), all the other images used were founded at the [National Library of Medicine MedPix](https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/home), a free open source database with over 59,000 indexed and curated images, organized, reviewed, approved, and curated free of charge for personal use and for local teaching at institutions.
