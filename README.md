# X-Ray Images Enhancement

## Abstract
The main objective of this project is to improve the visualization of fractured bones using three image enhancement algorithms: **contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization** (CLAHE), **unsharp masking** (UM) and  **high-frequency emphasis filtering** (HEF) After implementing these algorithms, we will discuss about the results and the difficulties found during the development of the project.

Unprocessed images of x-ray films, like this one of a chest, made by *Nikola Zivaljevic, M.D.* and found at the [National Sciente Foundation Multimedia Gallery](https://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.jsp?med_id=52110), will be used in this project.

## Images Source

Besides the first image (001.tif), found at the [National Sciente Foundation Multimedia Gallery](https://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.jsp?med_id=52110), all the other images used were founded at the [National Library of Medicine MedPix](https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/home), a free open source database with over 59,000 indexed and curated images, organized, reviewed, approved, and curated free of charge for personal use and for local teaching at institutions.

# X-Ray Images Enhancement - Final Report

## Unsharp Masking

Unsharp masking is a linear filter that is capable of amplify high-frequencies of an image. The first registry of this technique was made in Germany, during the 30s, in order to get a better resolution for some photos. In modern days, the same filter is used as a feature in present's image editing software, like GIMP or Photoshop.

The first step of the algorithm is to copy the original image and apply a gaussian blur into it (Blur intensity is defined by a setting called **Radius**).\
If we subtract the blurred image from the original image, we will obtain only the edges created by the blur. This is what we call **unsharped mask**.\
Finally, the enhanced image is collected after applying the following formula:
```
sharpened image = original image + amount * (unsharped mask)
```
The **radius** setting is related to the blur intensity (as explained before) because it defines the size of the edges. The **amount** setting, on the other hand, controls the intensity of the edges (how much dark or light it will be).

### Results
Even though this technique is quite simple, it's also very powerfull because we can have satisfying results with a linear time complexity O(n).

## Conclusion

For our algorithm's comparisons, we will use a [Toddler's Fracture of a Left Tibia](https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=118ab4b1-3fa7-4ce8-b332-6b6ce0632d90) from a 3 years old pacient. Fractures of the tibia and fibula are the most common injuries of the lower limbs in children.
